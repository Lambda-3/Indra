-- Saakashvili Accuses Russia as Protests Turn Violent -- Helena Bedwell -- 2007-11-07T19:18:32Z -- http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2007-11-07/saakashvili-accuses-russia-as-protests-turn-violent-update5-.html                                     Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili accused  Russia  of attempting to destabilize the country as anti-government protests in the capital Tbilisi turned violent.    Russia had a plan ``to overthrow the government in Georgia,'' Saakashvili said today in a televised address. ``We monitored every move. We saw how they were instructed and sponsored,'' he said, referring to the Georgian opposition. ``An alternative government was even created in Russia, ready for the moment when they achieved their goals.''    Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli declared a state of emergency at about 10:30 p.m. local time. No demonstrations will be allowed, and the media are expected to moderate their coverage of events, Nogaideli said in televised comments.    Georgian police confronted protesters with rubber bullets, clubs and tear gas in Tbilisi today, the first violent clashes since anti-government demonstrations began on Nov. 2, when as many as 100,000 people gathered to demand early parliamentary elections. The opposition later called on Saakashvili to resign.    The president called on opposition leaders who have a ``clear conscience'' to begin talks on finding a way out of  Georgia 's political standoff. The opposition made no reply, as about 500 activists sought shelter in Tbilisi's Holy Trinity Cathedral this evening. The church was surrounded by riot police.    Anti-Russian Hysteria    The Kremlin called Saakashvili's charges, and his decision to declare several officials at the Russian embassy in Tbilisi personae non gratae, ``anti-Russian hysteria,'' an unidentified official in the administration of President Vladimir Putin said in a statement released to the media.    The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saakashvili's remarks amounted to an ``irresponsible provocation'' and vowed to give a ``fitting reponse.''    ``We call on those who have direct influence on Tbilisi to warn the Georgian leadership against any further destructive steps fraught with unpredictable consequences,'' the ministry said in a  statement  posted on its Web site.    In his address to the nation, Saakashvili also said ``certain Russian oligarchs'' had called repeatedly ``for people to support the overthrow of the government.'' In response to a similar statement on Nov. 4, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Georgian government's response to the demonstrations was a ``farce.''    Tear Gas    Thousands of protesters skirmished with police in an unsuccessful attempt to block off the capital's main street, Rustaveli Avenue, and reclaim the square in front of parliament where rallies have been held daily since Nov. 2.    Riot police held protesters at bay using water cannons and tear gas before dispersing the crowd with rubber bullets and nightsticks. Many protesters fought back.    As many as 400 people requested medical care today, mostly for exposure to tear gas during the clashes, Health Ministry spokeswoman Nino Khochorashvili said by telephone. No serious injuries had been reported, she said.    Giga Bokeria, a member of parliament and an official in Saakashvili's National Party, told reporters in the parliament building that protesters had provoked the confrontation with police.    Patriarch Ilia II, head of the Georgian Orthodox Church, called for the government and opposition to resolve their differences at the negotiating table. ``The violence must stop,'' he said in a televised address this afternoon. ``The only way forward is dialogue.''    Caught on Tape    Georgian television stations today broadcast Interior Ministry footage showing four opposition leaders talking with people identified as Russian officials.    ``The individuals mentioned in the tape have been planning anti-government activities in cooperation with the Russian security services,'' Givi Targamadze, head of parliament's security committee and a senior official in Saakashvili's National Party, said in a telephone interview.    Targamadze said the four opposition leaders -- Giorgi Khaindrava, Konstantin Gamsakhurdia, Levan Berdzemishvili and Shalva Natelashvili -- would be charged with crimes against the state.    Khaindrava, a former conflict-resolution minister, was arrested on charges of narcotics use early today. After refusing to take a blood test, Khaindrava was fined and released, his lawyer, Gela Nikoleishvili, said by telephone.    Labor Party leader Natelashvili called for a nationwide strike to coincide with the Nov. 2 demonstration. The strike didn't take place. Gamsakhurdia, son of the late Georgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia, heads the Freedom Party, while Berdzemishvili is a leader of the Republican Party.    Berdzemishvili said in televised comments that the accusation against him was ``a vicious lie.''    Off the Air    About 9 p.m. local time, armed men in masks entered the headquarters of  Imedi  television, the station founded by Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili in 2001. The station soon went off the air.    A second local station, Kavkazia, also stopped broadcasting late today.    Mate Kirvalidze, a producer at Imedi, said by telephone that police special forces officers had seized the building where three opposition leaders were about to speak in a live interview.    An Imedi journalist said the company's employees were being held at gunpoint and that their mobile phones had been confiscated. She spoke from a doorway of Imedi's building in a live report on Rustavi-2 television.    News Corp. (NWSA) , the international media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, assumed control of Imedi on Oct. 31, shortly after Patarkatsishvili said he would fund the opposition.    Lewis Robertson, general director of  News Corp. (NWS) 's television and radio operations in Georgia, could not be reached for comment.
